I am currently a first-year doctoral student from School of Coumputer Science, Peking University, with a research focus on data-centric AI. I have the privilege of conducting my research under the guidance of Prof. Bin Cui.

My research interests revolve around the integration of data science and artificial intelligence, exploring how to leverage big data and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. I am particularly interested in areas such as data mining, data analysis, and knowledge graphs. I am dedicated to developing innovative algorithms and methods to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data processing and decision-making processes.

If you are interested in my research area or potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me via email at qinyanzhao123@pku.edu.cn. I look forward to engaging in academic discussions and working together with fellow researchers to advance the field of data-centric AI.

Thank you for your attention!
