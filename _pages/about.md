Welcome to my personal homepage! I’m a doctoral student in the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), under the guidance of Professor [Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). My research focuses on data-centric AI, specifically exploring the intersection of data analysis and artificial intelligence.

I’m open to collaborations, discussions, and connecting with fellow researchers and industry professionals. Please feel free to contact me via email at qinyanzhao123@pku.edu.cn.
